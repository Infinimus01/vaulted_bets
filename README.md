## 📌 Overview

**Vaulted Bets** is a responsive landing page designed for an exclusive sports betting intelligence community. This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in core frontend technologies, focusing on creating an engaging user experience through interactive animations and a modern, high-conversion design.

The site features a unique "Vault Door" entrance animation that sets the tone for the exclusive content within, followed by a clean, informative single-page layout.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Entrance Animation**: A custom CSS/JS animation sequence simulating a vault door unlocking and opening to reveal the site content.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Navigation**: implemented smooth scrolling for better user navigation between sections.
- **Dynamic Scroll Effects**: Utilizes the **Intersection Observer API** to trigger fade-in animations for content cards as the user scrolls.
- **Modern UI/UX**: clean typography, consistent color palette, and hover effects to enhance engagement.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated form handling with loading states and user feedback (simulated submission).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Custom animations, Flexbox, Grid, and responsive media queries.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: DOM manipulation, event handling, logic for animations, and Intersection Observers.
- **FontAwesome**: Iconography.
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Inter).

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project was built to solidify my understanding of:
- **CSS Animations & Transitions**: Orchestrating complex animation sequences using keyframes and JavaScript timing.
- **DOM Manipulation**: efficiently selecting and modifying page elements dynamically.
- **Responsive Web Design**: creating layouts that work on any screen size without relying on heavy frameworks like Bootstrap.
- **Web APIs**: Implementing the Intersection Observer API for performance-friendly scroll animations.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
